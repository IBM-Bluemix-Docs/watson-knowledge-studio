If you upgrade from a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} Free plan, you'll need to manually migrate your workspaces following the [backup and restore](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/backup-restore.html) process.

If you upgrade from a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} Lite plan to a Standard plan, {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} uses in-place migration. You don't need to do any manual migration.

**Note**: At this time, downgrading your plan on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is not supported. You can, however, manage users, storage, billing, and usage.
