# Migrating to IBM Cloud
{: #migrate}

On December 18, 2017, IBM launched {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudiofull}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, which marks the beginning of the process to migrate all {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} instances from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

**Note**: {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses the term _workspace_, while {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace uses the term _project_. The functionality is the same. Only the terminology is different.

If you don't have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, sign up on [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/){: new_window} by using your {{site.data.keyword.ibmid}} from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace.

   Your {{site.data.keyword.ibmid}} is the ID that you use to log in to {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace.
