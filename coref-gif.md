![Shows a user switching to Coreference mode, then clicking words that refer to Microsoft, the organization, including Microsoft Corp., Microsoft, and it. The user then double-clicks the last mention to create the coreference chain.](images/coref1.gif)

The chain is added to the Coreference Chains list in the sidebar, and is assigned a number. Within the document, the coreference chain number is displayed in subscript with each mention that belongs to that chain.
