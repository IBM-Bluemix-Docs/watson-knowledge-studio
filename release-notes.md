{: shortdesc}

## December 2017
{: #december2017}

### New features and changes
{: #new-december2017}

- {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} launched on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For information about the migration process and schedule, see [Migrating to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/client-migration.html).
- Redesigned navigation. For details about the navigation changes, see [Table 2](#september2017) in the September 2017 release notes.
- Added {{site.data.keyword.nlufull}} as a pre-annotator.
- Added user and storage management settings to the Service Details page. For information about adding users, see [Assembling a team](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/team.html). For information about setting storage limits, see [Troubleshooting > Storage space issues](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/troubleshooting.html#storage).
- Added a Performance page for model quality evaluation and guidance about how to improve quality.

## November 2017
{: #november2017}

### Changes
{: #new-november2017}

- Fixed an issue where some relation annotations were missing in the exported corpus.
- Fixed an issue where a model could not be withdrawn from deployment if its status was **None**.
- Fixed an issue where the model could not be evaluated for Korean.

## October 2017
{: #october2017}

### Changes
{: #new-october2017}

- Fixed the issue with the **Export** button not being enabled until you refreshed the browser window in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [experimental](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/troubleshooting.html#experimental) release.
- Fixed the button labels and tooltips to match the changes for the terms _upload_ and _download_ in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [experimental](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/troubleshooting.html#experimental) release. These terms  are used instead of _import_ and _export_ when referring to type systems, documents, and dictionaries.
- Fixed the delay in updating the descriptions on the {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} User Account Management page in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [experimental](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/troubleshooting.html#experimental) release.
- In the pre-annotation section of the interface, made a couple GUI changes to clarify the functionality of the machine learning model, the rule-based model, the dictionary, and {{site.data.keyword.alchemylanguagefull}}. Changed the button label from **Run** to **Pre-annotate**, changed the title of the window from **Run Annotator** to **Run Pre-annotation**, and changed the error message to clarify that you can't add automated annotations after humans annotated the documents.
- For projects or workspaces that use dictionary-based tokenizers, fixed an issue that showed empty sentences if you imported documents without ground truth.

## September 2017
{: #september2017}

### New features and changes
{: #new-sept17}

- Released a new front-end user experience for {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} as an [experimental](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/troubleshooting.html#experimental) service. Changes include a reorganized navigation and a new model performance analysis page. For a summary of the navigation changes, see the table in the known issues.
- Added Chinese (simplified) and Dutch language support.

### Known issues
{: #issues-sept17}

- For a rule-based model, after you map classes and entity types, the **Export** button is not enabled until you refresh the browser window.
- For the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [experimental](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/troubleshooting.html#experimental) release, some of the documentation terminology does not match the new interface. The documentation matches the interface in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace. The following terms have changed in the [experimental](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio/troubleshooting.html#experimental) release:

| Term in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace | Term in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|
| _project_ | _workspace_ | This term was changed because {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also uses the term _project_ |
| _import_ and _export_ | _upload_ and _download_ | The terms _import_ and _export_ are now referred to as _upload_ and _download_ when used in terms of documents and entity types. The term _export_ is still used when referring to exporting a model to applications such as {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer. |
